The purpose of this page is to bring you up to date on the Solo story and inform you of the plans for the Solo Heritage Trust and to seek your support for her preservation.
Solo’s almost 60 year history began on the 19th June 1955…the day she was launched at Pyrmont Harbour in Sydney. Her famous history is encapsulated in Jock Sturrock’s words:
</p>
<p>
        “Few yachts in the world could match Solo’s career as racer, cruiser and Antarctic explorer”
</p>
<p>
Since her retirement in 1979 Solo was put to work as a charter yacht operating first in the Whitsundays and for the last 20 years on Moreton Bay in south east Queensland. Solo has now passed her time as a commercial vessel as newer designs make for faster boat speeds and greater comfort. Her time has come to retire to the ‘long yard’.
</p>
<p>
Sadly the last few years have not been kind to Solo and she sits on the hardstand in a Brisbane shipyard melting away as the cancerous corrosion knaws at her steel. Several attempts have been made to pass her on to Australia’s Maritime institutions but all these efforts have failed and it now remains to a dedicated few to take the steps necessary to ensure the legend of Solo lives on.
</p>
<p>
The Solo Heritage Trust is now a registered organisation and is in the process of seeking charitable status with the Australian Taxation Office.
</p>
<p>
Ownership of the boat will be vested in the Trust whose objectives are to ensure her restoration to meet Queensland Maritime Survey requirements before launching. Once back in the water the Trust will hand over the operation to a third party who will manage her as a sailing vessel and undertake routine maintenance. 
</p>
<p>
It is estimated that $100,000 will be needed to meet the restoration costs and the first years’ management. The Trust will do all that is possible to utilise volunteers both in the restoration and the management but the fixed costs are still expected to be high.
</p>
<p>
Until the Trust gains charitable status the Trust is seeking financial pledges from the community which can be paid at a later date to gain the tax benefits.
</p>
<p>
All donations will be acknowledged and displayed on board Solo with plaques being presented to larger donors.
</p>
<p>
David Farley, a previous owner of Solo, has already agreed to donate $5000 a year for the next five years to the Trust.
</p>
<p>
Kevin Bourke has agreed to donate $5 from every sale of his book ‘Man of Iron Ship of Steel’.
